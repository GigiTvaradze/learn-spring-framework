/*
 * Tight Coupling vs Loose Coupling
 * -----------------------------------
 * Tight Coupling  : A situation where classes or components are highly dependent
 *                   on each other. Changes in one class usually require changes
 *                   in other related classes, making it harder to maintain and
 *                   modify the system.
 *
 * Loose Coupling  : A design approach where classes or components have minimal
 *                   dependencies on each other. Changes in one class do not
 *                   require changes in other classes, promoting flexibility,
 *                   maintainability, and testability.
